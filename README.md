I started learning pandas recently.

Since I learned Python, I found that it’s easier for beginners, people who are like me, to learn programming language if they just write the code down.
So when I started to learn pandas this time, instead of reading books or  watching online videos, I found several blogs which introduced the foundation knowledge of pandas and wrote down exactly what they introduced.
I think this is the quickest and most convenient way to master pandas.

Therefore I took what I learened and added it to Jupyter Notebook so that everyone can use this as a reverse lookup dictionary.
There are three parts of my Jupyter Notebook of pandas:

1. 勉強メモ｜pandasの超入門基礎知識.ipynb: This is the most basic part of pandas’ commands.
1. 勉強メモ｜pandasによるデータ処理.ipynb: This is used for data analyzing.
1. 勉強メモ｜初めての決定木.ipynb: This is an example of how to use decision trees to do data predictions.

I will update more examples of various approaches of sk-learn.
I hope you will like it and please let me know if there is anything that is not adequate.
